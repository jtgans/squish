description: !!python/unicode 'This is directly due to the way git was designed. Any
  directories without files

  in them are not stored in the scm. The end result is that when no tickets are in

  a given status, the directory disappears. We should fix init to add small, zero

  length dotfiles in each of the state directories to work around this. The

  findBugsByNumOrPartial method in Command should then be updated to catch

  filenames of that nature and not treat them as bugs.'
