description: !!python/unicode "Currently squish list shows off a nice multi-line output.\
  \ This is great for humans, but actually gets painful for scripts. We should add\
  \ a --concise option that takes a list of field names and displays each bug -- one\
  \ on each line -- with the selected fields. Ie:\n\n  $ squish list --concise=bugid,reporter,assignee\n\
  \  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx        \"Someone\" <at@zombie.com>        \"Someonelse\" <else@zorba.com>\n\
