Squish: The stupid bug tracker
==============================

Requirements
------------

PyYAML (python-yaml on Debian-derived distributions)


What is it?
-----------

Squish is a simple distributed bug tracker. Its main features are:

  - It stores its bugs in the same SCM as the source code the bugs refer to.

  - It can run arbitrary scripts on each event.

  - Bugs are tightly coupled with the code they reflect -- if you
    branch, the same set of bugs go with the newly created branch.

  - It's designed to work cleanly with distributed SCMs, so bug
    numbers are based upon SHA-1 hashes of the original contents.

  - Bugs are stored in a clean (mostly) markup-free YAML format that
    is human readable.
